# Binary Search Tree Implementation

A Java implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure with an interactive console menu interface. This project demonstrates fundamental tree operations and traversal algorithms.

## Features

* Insert nodes into the BST
* Delete nodes from the BST
* Search for specific values
* Tree traversal algorithms:
  * In-order
  * Pre-order
  * Post-order

## Usage

The program provides an interactive menu with the following options:
1. Insert a value
2. Delete a value
3. Search for a value
4. Display In-order traversal
5. Display Pre-order traversal
6. Display Post-order traversal
7. Exit

## Implementation Details

* Written in Java
* Implements a basic BST with integer values
* Each node contains a value and references to left and right child nodes
* Includes recursive implementations of tree operations

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the Java files
3. Run BSTProgram.java to start the interactive menu
